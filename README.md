About Me
Hi! I'm Yveson 👨‍💻, a self-taught programmer with a deep interest in technology, artificial intelligence, and the open-source world. I began my coding journey over 11 years ago with a Python book 📘, eventually building bots for automating trades in the financial market 💹 — always driven by curiosity and experimentation 🧠.

When tools like ChatGPT emerged 🤖, I saw a turning point. Since then, I've been diving deep into AI, studying independently through books and online courses. In the past two years, I've explored and used languages like Python 🐍, R 📊, C++ 🧱, Rust ⚙️, Dlang 🔧, and SQL 🗄️. Today, I'm capable of building my own AI models — and that's just the beginning 🚀.

I'm not currently seeking employment 👀, but I’m actively observing the tech job market and refining my skills, with the long-term goal of building a career aligned with AI, programming, and scientific computing.

Interests and Goals
Programming 💻: Passionate about clean code, low-level performance, and Linux-based workflows 🐧.

Artificial Intelligence 🧠: Focused on learning how models work under the hood 🔬, beyond just using libraries.

Lifelong Learning 📚: Committed to daily study and self-improvement, with a scientific and rational mindset 🧬.

What I'm Working On
Personal projects in Python, C++, and Rust — including AI experiments and game development 🎮.

Developing my first ML portfolio project focused on housing price prediction 🏘️📈.

Building out my public profiles and repositories to document my evolution and share knowledge 🌱.
